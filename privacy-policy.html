Privacy Policy
Vitara app. Last updated: February 2025.

1. General
This privacy policy describes how the Vitara app («app», «we») processes your data. Vitara is a mobile app for health journaling, viewing statistics, and chatting with an AI assistant. By using the app you agree to this policy.

2. Data we process
Health journal data — entries about your wellbeing, symptoms, dates and other information you add. By default they are stored only on your device (locally).
AI chat data — messages in the AI section may be sent to an AI provider (e.g. OpenAI) when you use that feature. This depends on your settings and API key.
Technical data — device and app version information may be used for stable operation (including via app stores and Expo).

3. Storage
Journal entries and app settings are stored locally on your device (e.g. MMKV/AsyncStorage). We do not send this data to third-party servers except when you use features that require it (e.g. AI chat).

4. Third parties
When you use the AI section, your messages may be processed by a third-party AI provider (e.g. OpenAI). Their privacy policy applies. We recommend not sharing sensitive medical identifiers in chat when unnecessary.

5. Your rights
You can delete app data at any time via device settings (clear app data) or by uninstalling the app. For requests or complaints about personal data, use the contact details in the app or store listing.

6. Security
We take reasonable measures to protect data stored in the app. Local data is protected by your device and operating system.

7. Changes
We may update this policy. Significant changes will be communicated in the app or on update. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated policy.

8. Contact
For privacy and data-related questions, contact us using the details in the app store listing or the project's official site.
